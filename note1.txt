"Wicab, has developed the BrainPort, a device designed to help people with serious vision loss navigate by translating visual data from a camera into vibrations on the tongue. BrainPort can also be used to assist people with balance disorders by providing tactile feedback on changes in the way the head tilts. Unfortunately, the technology seems unlikely to provide enough clear benefits to counterbalance the cost and annoyance of wearing the device"
